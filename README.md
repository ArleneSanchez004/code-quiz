# code-quiz

This website is a little code quiz I built to explore javascript further and to build skills in jQuery, bootstrap, and using local data storage.

To begin the quiz, click on "Start Quiz!". Any time you answer a question correctly, 25 points is added to your score. An incorrect answer will deduct 15 seconds from the timer. When either the timer reaches 0 or you finish all the questions, the Quiz is over and you can save your score. You can also click on the "View Highscores" button to see previous scores anytime.
